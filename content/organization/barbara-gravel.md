Barbara is a PhD student at the Interuniversity Institute of Bioinformatics in Brussels (IB²), a collaborative institute between the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Her research focuses on the development of machine learning models to predict and analyse oligogenic diseases. What she enjoys most about bioinformatics is the diversity of topics studied, and the fact that it brings together people from different backgrounds.
