## About the Workshops
### Exploratory and Confirmatory Data Analysis in Biology and Healthcare
This talk will explore the complementary roles of exploratory and confirmatory analysis in biology and health research, with a central focus on differential analysis. From traditional differential analysis on tabular data to more complex applications such as gene regulatory network inference and analysis, I will discuss how analytical approaches must be tailored to the specific goals and data characteristics of each application. By understanding these needs—whether generating new hypotheses, validating biological mechanisms, or supporting clinical decisions—we can better integrate exploratory and confirmatory methods to enhance both discovery and rigor in computational biology and health sciences.

*About the speaker:*
Panagiotis Mandros is a computer scientist developing theory and algorithms for applications in scientific discovery. He earned his PhD from Saarland University and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, where he focused on the algorithmic discovery of non-linear patterns in data. He later joined the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where he worked on the inference and analysis of gene regulatory networks to uncover novel disease mechanisms in cancer.

### From PCA to scGPT: exploring the high dimensional geometries of single-cell RNA-seq data
Single-cell RNA-seq data provide valuable insights into cellular biology, but their high dimensionality can make analysis difficult. In this workshop, we'll explore practical techniques for learning meaningful latent spaces that make these data easier to interpret and work with, from traditional linear methods to the latest approaches using large pre-trained transformer models.

*About the speaker:*
Aziz Fouché is a computational biologist with a background in computer science and biology from ENS Paris-Saclay and Sorbonne Université. Aziz Fouché completed his Ph.D. at Institut Curie, where he developed methods to analyze the geometry of single-cell transcriptomics data. He now works at Scienta Lab, a Paris-based start-up using large pre-trained models to predict treatment outcomes and identify biomarkers in immunology and inflammation.

### Foundational models for genomics
The human genome sequence provides the underlying code for human biology. Understanding the sequence-code of the genome is vital for understanding how genetic variants affect human disease and traits, but it has remained one of the biggest challenges in biology. In an era of exponential growth of genomics and biomedical data, deep learning methods and more specifically foundation models have emerged as powerful tools to aid this goal due to their capacity to identify highly complex patterns in large datasets. Can these models that have revolutionized image recognition and natural language also help us decode the human genome and advance personalized medicine? In this workshop, we will provide an overview of how foundation models can be used to decode the genome, discuss specific models and applications, and get hands-on experience implementing them.

*About the speaker:*
Bernardo Almeida is a Senior Research Scientist at InstaDeep in Paris where he is developing large language foundational models for biology. He received his PhD in 2023 from the University of Vienna after his work on deep learning models to understand the regulatory information encoded in the genome sequence. Earlier, he obtained his undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences and masters in Oncobiology from the University of Algarve, Portugal.
