RSG Belgium, the regional student group of the International Society for Computational Biology kindly invites you to the first Bioinformatics Student Symposium of 2018, organized in collaboration with [biomina][biomina].

<!-- [Click here for a flyer of the event.](assets/pdf/poster_rsg_symposium-22-05-18.pdf) -->

The main goal of this event is providing a forum for young researchers and students in bioinformatics to present their work and network with peers.

Our keynote speaker is [Prof. dr. Kris Laukens][krislaukens] of the Antwerp University. Prof. Laukens is a bioinformatics researcher in the Adrem Data Lab and the founder of the biomina research network. He specializes in the use and development of data mining technologies for big molecular data in order to address medical and biological problems. His two core research areas are biomolecular pattern discovery and biological networks.

## Mark the date

**Tuesday, the 22nd of May 2018**

## Location

Room C101 - City Campus University of Antwerp,
Prinsstraat 13, 2000 Antwerp.
