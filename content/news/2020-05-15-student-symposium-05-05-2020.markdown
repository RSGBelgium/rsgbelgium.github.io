## RSG Belgium Student Symposium and Data Visualisation Workshop -  Mark the date - Friday the 5th of May 2020

RSG Belgium, the regional student group of the International Society for Computational Biology, kindly invites you to the annual Bioinformatics Student Symposium. The main goal of this event is to provide a forum for young researchers and students in bioinformatics where they can present their work, get updated about current research topics and network with their peers.

**The year's symposium will be held at UCLouvain on Friday 05/05/2020.**

This year's **keynote lecture** will be provided by **[Prof. Dr. Laurent Gatto](https://www.deduveinstitute.be/fr/research/computational-biology/laurent-gatto)** of the de Duve Institute in UCLouvain. Since September 2018, Laurent Gatto is an Associate Professor of Bioinformatics at the UCLouvain, in Belgium, and director of the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBIO) group. Located in the de Duve Institute, on the medical campus in Brussels, he runs a research group and teaches at the faculty of pharmacy and biomedical sciences (FASB). Since 2010, he has focused on the processing and analysis of mass-spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics data. Laurent Gatto is an avid open research advocate and make every possible effort to make his research reproducible and openly available.

In addition to the keynote lecture, we will for the first time organize an accompanying **workshop** in the morning before the symposium. **[Prof. Dr. Jan Aerts](https://www.uhasselt.be/dsi)** from the Data Science Institute at UHasselt will walk us through the most important concepts in data visualisation for biological data.

## Abstract call (deadline 05/04/2020)
