## Linting & Formatting

- Run `npm run lint` to check for lint errors (uses ESLint).
- Run `npm run format` to auto-format code (uses Prettier).
- Pre-commit hooks (optional): Set up with Husky to enforce code style.

## Testing

- Run `npm test` to execute all tests (uses Jest and React Testing Library).
- Add tests for all new features and components.
- Test coverage is tracked (see badge above).

## Accessibility

- Components are built with accessibility (a11y) in mind.
- Please use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where appropriate.
- Run accessibility audits (e.g., Lighthouse) before major releases.

## Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

- GitHub Actions run linting, tests, and builds on every pull request and push to `main`.
- The site is automatically deployed when changes are merged to `main`.
